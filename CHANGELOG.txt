SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-05-10
--------------------------------------
- MariaDb client: there's no means of getting native error until successful
  connection.
- NB: MySQLi multi-query isn't executed until getting result set.
- Classify native error codes, to discern connection|query|result error
  in places where ambiguous.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-05-06
--------------------------------------
- Result set index initial value -1.
  Native row fetching methods implicitly go to first result set; unless moved.
- Result nextSet/nextRow() shall optionally not throw exception on error.
- Query constructor must trim arg sql before checking for emptyness.
- Error message prefix is now Database[client name][rmdbs type][database name].
- Do NOT close statement/free result before getting native error.
- MariaDb query must have own nativeError() because \mysqli_stmt has own
  separate error list.
- Result fetchField method, which gets value; not column metadata.
- Aborted columnMetadata() method, because for Sqlsrv it's a query thing
  (sqlsrv_field_metadata(), no execution) whereas for MySQLi it's a result thing
  (mysqli_fetch_field()); and too much work anyway.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-05-03
--------------------------------------
- No custom LogicExceptions; logical exceptions should be detected during
  dev/test, and it's better that all (unexpected) database exceptions
  are/inherit from a single class (DbRuntimeException).
- (prepared statement) Prevent de-referencing when using an arguments list
  whose value buckets aren't set as &$value.
- MsSqlQuery case-insentive search for insert ID magic extra query.
- Readme MS SQL example must have certain options for providing affected rows
  and insert ID.
- Readme describe engines.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-05-02
--------------------------------------
- Parameter value escaper shan't escape semicolon, not even when multi-query.
- Result nextRow() is a result interface method.
- MariaDb nextRow() shan't always fail.
- All multi-query features moved to separate (extending) interfaces and classes;
  MS SQL implementation no longer relates to multi-querying at all.
- Forbid reconnecting if unfinished transaction.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-05-01
--------------------------------------
- prepare() support associative arguments array.
- MS SQL insertId() shan't err when ID ;-)
- Better query logging.
- Sql string variables renamed to 'sql'; from 'query'.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-04-30
--------------------------------------
- MS SQL insertId(), and better error handling.
- Freeing result is result method, not a query method.
- Result constructor must accommodate (MySQLi) connection object as well
  as statement.
- An abstract class doesn't have to implement methods of an interface.
- insertId() must return null when query didn't trigger setting an ID.
- MariaDb result; entirely untested, and still wondering about the nature
  of non-selecting multi-queries vs. mysql_multi_query.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-04-24
--------------------------------------
- Clarify which methods are 'package protected'; @internal.
- Order sequence of methods in code by relevance to user.
- More exceptions must be preceded by unsetting prepared statement arguments
  reference.
- Log query in more situations. Use a random query ID to correlate log warnings
  with exceptions.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-04-23
--------------------------------------
- Prepared statement arguments reference unsetting problem solved by setting
  the reference on an array bucket of an instance var; instead of on the
  instance var itself.
- Err on attempt to execute() closed statement.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-04-22
--------------------------------------
- MS SQL client info.
- The parameter marker is now a constant; not necessarily question mark.
- Splitting query by parameter marker - and checking for parameters/arguments
  count mismatch - moved to decidated method.
- MS SQL query use automated parameter substitution even when non-prepared
  statement.
- Handle that query instance var prepared-statement-arguments is a reference,
  and that unsetting it renders the query object useless.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-04-21
--------------------------------------
- Check parameter types.
- Query multi-query features sorted.
- Client options resolved into separate optionsResolved property.
  And connection flags is a MariaDb/MySQL-only feature.
- Client public optionsResolve() to facilitate debugging.
- MS SQL query and result complete.

SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-04-20
--------------------------------------
- Client getConnection() shan't default to re-connect.
- Refer prepared statements arguments.
- Close prepared statement on query object destruction.
- Uniform error messages, stating database type and client name.
- Query execute.
- Forbid starting transaction when previously ditto isn't terminated yet.
- Document that MariaDB prepared statement requires the mysqlnd driver.
  Because a result set will eventually be handled as \mysqli_result
  via mysqli_stmt::get_result(); only available with mysqlnd.


SimpleComplex/Database 1.x, 2018-04-19
--------------------------------------
- Initial.
